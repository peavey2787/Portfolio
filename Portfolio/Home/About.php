    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Jamie. I live in Wichita Falls, Texas, but I’m originally from Indiana. I was tired of the cold and the economy is better in Texas. My work history consists of primarily labor intensive production jobs, but I currently work at home doing Crowdsource work such as web search results analysis. Although I have hardly any IT work related experience, I fell in love with computers when my father gave me my first one at the age of 6. It had a giant monitor that displayed only green text and no mouse. Ever since I have taken all the computer programming and HTML classes I could in High School. Along with several college classes at South University. In fact, I already have my associate’s degree in Computer Science-Information Technology, and I am only a few months away from obtaining my Bachelors of Science in the same area.
        <br/><br/>
        My strongest soft skill is my creativity and resourcefulness. I enjoy getting the most out of what I have to work with, anywhere from overclocking hardware to recycling cardboard boxes as tables. I find creative solutions to problems others wouldn’t think of. My strongest hard skill is my proficiency in C#, as it is the primary language I use to create applications.
