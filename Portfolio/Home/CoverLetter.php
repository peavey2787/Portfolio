	<p>I am a small needle in a haystack as an aspiring Software Developer, but what sets me apart from the rest is my creativity, and resourcefulness. Along with my superb work ethic and reliability. I possess the required skills and I’m passionate about creating quality software.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<p>Specifically, I have created several applications using the C# language and object oriented principles. At South University I have learned how to define system scope, and develop accurate system requirements. Along with obtaining an in-depth knowledge about the various modern software development methodologies, and experience with software configuration management systems such as TFS and GitHub. I have even created a personal blog website powered with a SQL database using ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<p>If you are as excited about this opportunity as I am, please feel free to contact me any time via e-mail. Thanks for taking the time to review my resume. I hope to hear from you soon to setup an interview. That way we can get to know one another better, and determine if this needle is a good fit for the position and vice versa.</p>
