          <b>Description: </b>The objective of this project is to ensure my VPN connection stays connected, and to save energy while watching a movie on my laptop. It will briefly pause the full screen movie to alert me its fully charged and okay to unplug. Along with a message box alerting me when the battery is low as Windows will not interrupt my full screen movie to alert me.
